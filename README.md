<h3>What is this contraption for?</h3>
-It is used to delay the start of an electrical device if there was power loss
<br>
<h2> Examples of uses and explanation </h2>
-Some electrical devices such as friges are fitted with a compressor inside. When the compressor is switched off due to power loss
it is not recomended to directly turn it on again (Some friges have a safety system to prevent this but not all have this feature)
it is recomended to wait a couple of minuites before turning it back on
<br>
-So this contraption basicly does that automaticly when the power cuts off and turns back on it will wait for a specified time before turning on the electronic device connected to it
<br>
-So it would make the electronic devices or machines connected to it last longger espesially if you live in an area with constant and repeated black outs or power loss
.
